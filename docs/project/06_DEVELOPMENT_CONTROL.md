# Codex Room — Development Control

**Last updated:** 2026-09-20
**Scope:** Volatile current focus, ordered priorities, known issues, planned work, and unresolved questions.
**Freshness:** High volatility. Replace dated state promptly when newer evidence or user direction exists.

## Operator summary

- **Where are we?** I-025 — **PBM v3 one-paste workflow** — is the selected development item. PBM v2 remains COMPLETE / VERIFIED and no live paid PBM benchmark has run.
- **What just changed?** D-047 selects PBM v3: one initial principal instruction in Desktop and one in a controller Room, while preserving fresh native Desktop child tasks, fresh benchmark Rooms, the eight frozen task assets, v2 context snapshots, alternating arm order, and D-039 naturalistic Room cognition. The feature branch contains an implementation candidate; no paid benchmark task has run.
- **Verification state:** PBM v2 remains verified under E-164. PBM v3 is IMPLEMENTATION CANDIDATE / NEEDS VERIFICATION. It requires deterministic exact-head verification plus a bounded native Desktop controller preflight proving fresh-task creation/wait/thread-id capture and a Room-controller launch preflight before v3 may replace v2 on canonical `main`.
- **What is next?** Finish/review the PBM v3 candidate, run exact-head deterministic verification, then perform the cheapest bounded controller preflight that proves one-paste mechanics without executing the eight benchmark tasks.
- **What is blocked?** No high-priority conceptual blocker prevents ordinary use or further development. Individual deferred items retain their own gates.
- **What are we deliberately not doing?** No Room-local plugin mutation endpoint, principal-proof security subsystem solely for plugin administration, generic config editor, copied marketplace/plugin manager, built-in Codex subagents, autonomous fan-out, automatic model router, or speculative host-parity project.

## Current development state

### I-025 — PBM v3 one-paste workflow

**Scope:** [benchmark operator workflow / native Desktop task controller / deterministic Room controller]

**Work state:** IN PROGRESS

**Reality / evidence:** IMPLEMENTATION CANDIDATE / NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Decision:** D-047

PBM v3 preserves the frozen PBM workload and measurement semantics while removing repeated human prompt/command choreography.

Candidate behavior:

- `benchmarks/pbm/CURRENT` resolves to v3 on the feature branch;
- the principal opens Desktop on `pbm_desktop_controller` and supplies one instruction: read/execute `DRIVER.md`;
- the Desktop controller performs coordination only and uses native fresh-task management for each Desktop arm; there is no Codex CLI fallback;
- exactly one current Desktop task is staged at a time under the controller folder, while graders/oracles and historical results remain outside the intended child workspace;
- PBM creates one controller Room, stages its files, starts its Round, and has C enter a private principal-consultation wait before any benchmark work;
- the principal's one Room paste is the private reply instructing C to read/execute `PBM_ROOM_DRIVER.md`;
- that controller Room then launches a detached deterministic worker, which creates a fresh ordinary Room for every Room benchmark arm;
- the original sixteen-arm alternating sequence remains authoritative;
- v2 run/task-pair contextual snapshots remain in force;
- D-039 dynamic Room model/reasoning allocation remains part of the measured product behavior;
- Desktop-controller and Room-controller usage are recorded separately from task execution usage, with an all-in view also produced;
- native approval dialogs may still require principal action and are not treated as new benchmark prompts;
- the v3 fingerprint binds orchestration code and driver files in addition to the inherited task assets.

**Verification gate:** before merge/promotion, exact-head deterministic tests must pass and a bounded controller-only preflight must establish that the actual Desktop surface can create/wait on a fresh native task and return its thread id, while the controller Room can launch its deterministic worker. Do not spend the eight-task PBM run merely to verify orchestration mechanics.

### I-024 — PBM v2 contextual baseline

**Scope:** [benchmark measurement protocol / read-only native account + environment context]

**Work state:** COMPLETE

**Reality / evidence:** IMPLEMENTED / EXACT-HEAD VERIFIED / READ-ONLY PREFLIGHT VERIFIED / LIVE PAID PBM NOT YET EXECUTED

**Decision:** D-046

**Evidence:** E-164

PBM v2 keeps the PBM v1 workload unchanged while adding interpretive context before and after benchmark work.

Implemented behavior:

- `benchmarks/pbm/CURRENT` resolves to v2;
- the v2 manifest inherits v1 task assets and fingerprints both version trees;
- v1 can still be explicitly reproduced through `--version v1`;
- each v2 run captures `run-start` and `run-end` snapshots;
- each task pair captures one pre-pair and one post-pair snapshot;
- snapshots attempt read-only native `account/rateLimits/read` and `account/usage/read` plus safe runtime/config/tool inventory and local repository/environment provenance;
- snapshot sanitation removes account identity/credential fields while retaining usage/credit/rate-limit semantics;
- native snapshot failures are recorded as unavailable and do not fabricate values;
- primary Desktop/Room usage accounting and deterministic quality graders remain unchanged from v1.
- the Room arm remains naturalistic under D-039: C may dynamically allocate ordinary model/reasoning configurations for itself and peers, and PBM records rather than suppresses those choices.

**Implementation boundary:** satisfied for v2. Snapshot reads are non-cognitive and read-only; the preflight produced no Codex rollout traffic and no task-execution state. They provide interpretive context only and do not replace rollout/Room execution accounting.

### I-023 — PBM (Performance Benchmark)

**Scope:** [benchmark tooling + paired Codex Desktop / Codex Room execution]

**Work state:** COMPLETE

**Reality / evidence:** IMPLEMENTED / EXACT-HEAD VERIFIED / LIVE PBM RUN NOT YET EXECUTED

**Decision:** D-045

PBM is the canonical standardized performance benchmark for comparing ordinary Codex Desktop with Codex Room across a fixed, versioned suite of paired tasks. The principal invocation **“Run PBM”** must resolve to the current canonical PBM procedure rather than triggering ad hoc benchmark design.

PBM v1 establishes:

- a frozen versioned task suite spanning trivial mechanical work through larger ambiguous/verification-heavy work;
- exact paired starting fixtures and prompts;
- fresh isolated Desktop and Room executions without cross-arm contamination;
- a primary naturalistic comparison in which each product operates as designed, plus a controlled mode where useful for isolating coordination/model effects;
- provider usage accounting using existing rollout instrumentation, with Room A/B/C usage aggregated;
- elapsed-time, tool-call, failure/retry, model/effort, agent-invocation, and coordination-waste measurements;
- deterministic task-specific acceptance checks and explicit quality/correctness outcomes;
- machine-readable run records and a standard human-readable comparison report;
- a low-cost pilot before broader replication, so the benchmark itself does not recreate previously observed high-cost synthetic testing.

**Implementation boundary:** satisfied for v1. The procedure, fixtures, measurement semantics, and reporting contract are now frozen and mechanically inspectable. Future material changes require a new benchmark version rather than silent mutation of v1.

PBM v1 separates the product arms mechanically:

- `pbm-desktop.ps1` prepares a fresh Desktop workspace/prompt and captures the matching native Desktop rollout only after the principal runs the task in a fresh Codex Desktop chat;
- `pbm-room.ps1` prepares a fresh Room without starting cognition, stages the same fixture, then separately starts/waits/exports/captures the Room arm;
- `codex_room/pbm.py` owns only shared deterministic manifest, fixture, grader, accounting, and report logic;
- PBM v1 remains frozen and explicitly reproducible; `benchmarks/pbm/CURRENT` now resolves the canonical live-use version, PBM v2, which inherits those exact eight v1 task assets and adds the verified contextual snapshot protocol.

**Verification:** E-163. The tested PR head and canonical merge commit have the same Git tree. No live PBM task execution is claimed by this verification.

### I-022 — Native Codex capability exposure and execution-economics audit

**Scope:** [CORE + ROOM UI audit; native Codex/App Server first]

**Work state:** COMPLETE

**Reality / evidence:** EXPLORATORY AUDIT COMPLETE / VERIFIED / NO IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED

**Evidence:** E-159, E-160

I-022 separated three questions that must not be collapsed:

1. does exact Codex 0.154 expose a primitive;
2. can Codex Room's SDK/runtime call or inherit it;
3. should Codex Room expose/adapt it as a product feature.

The exact-source audit verified native support for active-turn steering/interruption, model discovery, provider-thread lifecycle controls, native review, rate-limit/usage reads, permission profiles, command/file/permission approvals, tool user-input requests, structured image/local-image inputs, managed-worktree machinery, browser/computer-use feature/configuration surfaces, remote-environment contracts, and other host/runtime facilities.

E-160 then compared those families by current Room status, principal value, inherent cognition cost, continuation/context implications, overlap with Room mechanisms, authority burden, and implementation complexity.

**Selection boundary:** I-022 is not an implementation queue. Any feature-specific runtime probe, implementation slice, revival of a deferred feature such as D-019, or host-integration project requires separate principal selection. Built-in Codex subagents remain disabled.

### I-021 — Principal-controlled Codex plugin management

**Scope:** [native Codex/ChatGPT administration + existing Room visibility/use]

**Work state:** COMPLETE

**Reality / evidence:** NATIVE-HOST PATH SELECTED / VERIFIED AS A PRODUCT BOUNDARY

**Decision / evidence:** D-043; E-157, E-158, E-162

Stage A verified the exact Codex 0.154 plugin/configuration contracts and proved that an A/B/C-equivalent Windows `:workspace` sandbox can reach Codex Room's loopback API, so a Room-local unauthenticated mutation route cannot establish principal-only authority.

Stage B resolved the remaining product choice in favor of native administration. Exact Codex 0.154 already provides human-facing plugin discovery, install/uninstall, enable/disable, marketplace, and app-auth handoff surfaces; current official OpenAI product guidance also exposes plugin installation and management through ChatGPT/Codex surfaces. Codex Room does not override ordinary plugin configuration, already inspects native plugin/skill/MCP/app state for Status & Tools, and can use inherited capabilities through the underlying Codex runtime.

Therefore I-021 closes without a Room-side mutation bridge, copied plugin manager, credential/auth proxy, or new principal-proof security subsystem. Reopen only if ordinary use demonstrates a concrete material cost or capability gap from managing plugin state through the native host.

## Approved or deferred work

### D-019 — Personal daily usage pacing

**Work state:** DEFERRED

**Reality:** DECIDED / NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Evidence:** E-026

The approved baseline remains a configurable daily pacing limit defaulting to one-seventh of the weekly allowance (~14.3%), using structured provider usage/rate-limit data rather than Room token estimates.

Implementation remains deferred until the mixed subscription-allowance versus purchased-credit semantics are understood well enough to define which pool is paced and how multiple pools interact. I-022 verified that exact 0.154 exposes richer account rate-limit/usage structures, but that source-level fact does not by itself resolve the product semantics or reactivate D-019.

### QoL wishlist

Wishlist entries are idea capture, not a work queue. Selection requires an explicit principal choice.

**Implemented / verified:**
- observer composer Enter-to-send / Shift+Enter newline — PR #133;
- composer focus retention — PR #135;
- auto-growing observer composer — PR #135;
- per-Room unsent drafts — PR #135.

**Unselected ideas:**
- new-activity / jump-to-latest control;
- one-click operational-ID copying / Copy diagnostics;
- Room search and filtering;
- transcript detail/noise controls;
- clear immediate action feedback;
- local persistence for harmless presentation preferences;
- conservative navigation/focus keyboard shortcuts;
- copy action on individual agent responses.

## Maintenance / monitor

### PR #110 failed-delegation fallback behavior

**Work state:** MONITOR

**Reality:** IMPLEMENTED / EXACT-HEAD VERIFIED / NATURALISTICALLY SUPPORTED

E-126 shows the tightened fallback path operating as intended: a nonproductive delegated follow-up was followed by substantial fallback work on a fresh capable peer rather than C's accumulated coordinator context. Continue ordinary-use observation; do not purchase a dedicated synthetic benchmark.

### Exact-turn interruption reconciliation

**Work state:** MONITOR

**Reality:** IMPLEMENTED / REVIEWED / VERIFIED TO SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

E-127 records the reproduced false interruption, diagnosis, and bounded repair. E-129 adds a normal post-repair continuation that closed by `transaction_settled`. Do not widen the interrupted-only grace or redesign reconciliation absent recurrence.

### I-003 — Provider-side instruction adoption after same-thread profile rebind

**Work state:** MONITOR

**Reality:** NEEDS VERIFICATION / current recurrence not demonstrated

Local rebind mechanics and fail-closed identity behavior are verified. Independent provider-side proof that replacement developer instructions took effect on the resumed same thread remains unproven. Do not spend a dedicated paid test unless ordinary use makes this uncertainty consequential.

### Naturalistic continuation economy

**Work state:** MONITOR

E-086 showed that continuation-economy repair can radically reduce tool-loop replay on a controlled fixture; E-090 showed broader source work can still become expensive; E-129 records a smaller zero-tool relay recurrence. Continue ordinary-use monitoring. Optimize demonstrated expensive patterns rather than purchasing synthetic tests without a concrete recurrence.

### Common Cause disposition

The Common Cause implementation/repair/verification work is complete and the artifact is verified play-ready (E-125–E-129). Competitive play is **not development work** and is not an active/planned roadmap item. It may begin only if the principal separately authorizes that activity. Continue to use any future ordinary play only as incidental evidence for monitored coordination behavior; do not manufacture benchmark traffic.

## Repository-development hygiene

- canonical source is private GitHub repo `strigoi73-sudo/codex-room`, branch `main`;
- routine change verification uses `verify-fast.cmd`; `verify-full.cmd` is the exhaustive/manual path;
- GitHub Actions are not the routine verification gate after the documented pre-runner failures;
- exact current refs/working-tree state are live Git/GitHub facts, not maintained prose;
- the complete `data/` tree is runtime/generated state and is ignored by Git;
- superseded open PRs #91 and #121 were closed during the 2026-09-20 roadmap audit;
- old unmerged/superseded remote feature branches may remain as Git history residue; they are not active roadmap work. Remove them only after verifying they are obsolete, and do not treat branch existence as work-state authority.

## Deferred work

Keep these deferred unless new evidence or explicit principal direction reprioritizes them:

- archive indexing/embeddings/broad summarization beyond bounded `HISTORY`;
- automatic CORE model routing (C-controlled D-039 allocation is separate);
- broader deterministic-tooling promotion without demonstrated reuse;
- stronger per-capability OS isolation;
- shareable/redacted exports;
- large-module refactors/storage optimization;
- broader productization/packaging/funding;
- Enterprise workforce features;
- provider-neutral implementation work;
- setup/onboarding wizard;
- blanket Desktop host parity or broad browser/computer-use integration without demonstrated need;
- nonessential UI refinement.

## Open questions

No high-priority conceptual question currently blocks ordinary Codex Room use or development.

Current unresolved questions are feature-local rather than roadmap-global:

- if ordinary use later demonstrates material friction from native-host plugin administration, what exact gap justifies reopening I-021;
- if D-019 is selected again, how should mixed subscription allowance and purchased credits interact;
- if browser/computer use, worktrees, remote execution, attachments, native review, steering, approvals, or other I-022 families are selected, what is the smallest native reuse that preserves Room semantics and execution economics.

I-025 PBM v3 one-paste workflow is the selected development item. Until v3 is exact-head and controller-preflight verified on canonical `main`, PBM v2 remains the last verified live-use version.
